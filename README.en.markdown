# SYNOPSIS 
An highlight content is an aggregation of many mixed types contents.
Theoretically, it is possible to add to this collection any content by its type and id.

# Concepts and contents

## HIGHLIGHT 
A `highlight` content carries the following information:

* a name. optional but necessary if the highlight can't be found by the content it is attached to.
* a reference to a content by its type and id. It is possible to find a highlight content from the content it is attached to.
* a ordered collection of objects representing the contents to bring up. Required. we'll call these objects _items._ These are defined just below

## ITEM 
An `item` content carries these informations:

* a reference to a mixed typed content. This is the content that will be displayed.
* an image. optional. Will be used as cover in place of the default one of the linked content.
* a paragraph. Optional. Will be used as introduction in place of the default one of the linked content.
* a link. optional. Will be used as replacement for the permalink of the linked content.

## CRAWLER
A `crawler` is an object that, given a specific query, can return a list of contents that match this query.
This module provides an abstract crawler. that has close to no crawling logic. it could have been an interface.
it also provides a default crawler. That is configurable and can crawler through tables with keywords.
have a look at `Highlight_Model_Crawler_Abstract` and `Highlight_Model_Crawler_Default` as well as the module config 

## FIELD MAPPER
Because the contents returned in a highlight can be of such different structure. it is necessary, when you need
to display them, to have simple tools to unify these structures a little.
A field mapper is an object that, given a row, can return an array with, at least, the following fields

* title: The title of the highlight item
* description: a short paragraph about the highlight item
* link: A link to the highlighted content
* cover: an image to go with the highlighted content

This module provides an Interface and a default mapper that read which fields to read from in a given order.
have a look at the module config files and the field mapper classes.
Of course, if the `item` itself defines any of the fields described above, those will see themselves overriden

# IMPLEMENTATION

Here follows a little guide on how to add highlights to your project

These very simple things will allow you to make lists of contents attached to a name you define in configuration
or a content of any type

## Named highlights

### definition

The concept of named highlights is very simple. Somewhere in your config files, you make a list of
highlights that you will be able to retrieve from your view in order to display them.

Here's how you go about that: create or open the config file in application/configs/highlight.ini

```ini

highlight.named_highlights[] = "home_carousel"
highlight.named_highlights[] = "home_footer"

```

In this example. We created two named highlights that were added to the highlight.named_highlights config array.

### management

How do we edit the content that will show up in these highlights?
go to the following url on your project: `/highlight/admin-highlight`.

You will be presented with and interface with one or more blue squares. each of these represents an `item`.
The last one is an empty one, ready to be added.

You can add one by clicking on the 'edit' action button. (little pen icon)
A form pops up at the top of the page with a text field. If you type in it, you should see some smart autocomplete pop
just under it. The default crawler looks for flatpages only. but that should do fine for now.


Click add, and your item is added and is linked to the flatpage you selected !

If you repeat the operation you'll find yourself with a bunch of highlight items. you can drap and drop them to reorder
them. Don't forget to click "save order" at the bottom of the page.

### displaying highlights

Still using the simplest way here. let's see how, in a view script, we can display a named highlight.

let's look at this sample code:

```php

<?php
    $container = $this->getHighlightContainer('home_footer');
?>
<?php if($container) : ?>
    <ul>
    <?php foreach($container->getHighlights() as $highlight) : ?>
        <li>
            <h3><?php echo $highlight['title'] ?></h3>
            <p><?php echo $highlight['description'] ?></p>
            <a href="<?php echo $highlight['link'] ?>">
                <img src="<?php echo $highlight['cover']->getStaticUrl() ?>" />
            </a>
        </li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
    </ul>
<?php endif ?>

```

* first we retrieve the highlight container object by its name, using the view helper `GetHighlightContainer`.
* after checking that we actually did get a container we start to display a unordered list
* we retrieve each highlight item with the `getHighlights` method.
* for each of those, we display a list element with various information

The `GetHighlightContainer` helper takes a name as parameter and retrieve the corresponding highlight container. we'll
see later that it can do a bit more than that.

The `getHighlights` method of a container instance returns a collection of mapped arrays of our items. We used it with
no parameters, but you would in fact be able to override the field mapper in use. The default one is used otherwise.



## Highlights for a specific content

Well all this is nice and swell but. let's say I want to pick 3 articles that will show in the sidebar when reading my
article about my last trip in Switzerland.
I could define a named highlight for this particular case of course, and just check in my controller if i should display
this highlight.

But what if I want to do this on any other article as well? Well, this module lets you attached a highlight container
by proxy model. In effect, you attach a container to the content of your choice. Let's go through the step of doing so

### Letting the highlight admin interface know what is your current content

The highlight admin interface check for various parameters in the url to see if it should manage highlights for a
specific content. These parameters are:

* `proxy_pk`: the Primary key of your content.
* `proxy_content_type_id`: The id of the content type of your content.

Of course you could write those by hand. But let's all agree that this is a bit tedious. I personally prefer something
that generates the correct URL for me.

Let's open the admin CRUD controller of your favourite content. I like user profiles.

```php

<?php

class User_AdminProfileController extends Centurion_Controller_CRUD
                                  implements Highlight_Traits_Controller_CRUD_Interface
{
    public function init()
    {

        // ... nothing left to change actually
 

```


See what I did? I just added the `implements Highlight_Traits_Controller_CRUD_Interface` part to the class declaration.
This is the way Centurion handles traits mechanisms, because not everyone can get the latest PHP version, right?

What does this trait does? I simply adds, in the crud list, a column at the very end with a link to manage highlights.
This is the generated url I was talking about. It contains the parameters needed for the highlight admin to attach a
container to our custom content.

_/!\ Due to some weird urlencoding of callback url parameters, There's no way to return to the content whose
highlights we are editing right now. This is however definitely on the feature list_

### Retrieving highlights from a content

Well this paragraph is gonna be small. You do exactly the same way as for a named highlights, except you don't give
a name as a string to the view helper, but the row instance of the content you are handling.

## Overriding default behaviours

What I described until here is what you can achieve using a very tiny amount of code writing or configuration.

This module also provied some base classes and utilities to override the default behaviour of the different entities

### Custom crawlers

The first thing you'll probably need to override is the crawler in use for your various highlights containers.
This is hard to make generic because, we could hardly assume what your specific content type will look like.

_TODO: a wiki page about the crawler component alone_

#### letting your highlight interface know what crawler to use

There are different ways to tell the admin highlight controller which crawler to use. If it fails finding any, it will
use the default one.

First of all, you can declare any crawler you like in the configuration in the namespace `highlight.crawlers.*`.
The crawler Factory (`Highlight_Model_Crawler_Factory::get`) takes a string as first argument. From this string 'crawlername' it reads
the config array `highlight.crawlers.crawlername`. It then instanciate an object of the class defined in
`highlight.crawlers.crawlername.className`, giving the whole config array as parameter to the constructor.


###### url parameter:

add a `crawler` parameter to the url and it will use the crawler by that name from the configuration files.
You should look how to override the construction of the highlight url in the Highlight_Traits_Controller_CRUD

######in the configuration:

for a named highlight. Instead of adding your name highlight to an array with

```ini

highlight.named_highlights[] = "home_carousel"

```

you can declare it with a crawler as parameter like so:

```ini

highlight.named_highlights.home_carousel.crawler = "my_funny_crawler"

```

###### In the proxy row:

When managing a highlight of a proxy, if the given proxy row model implement the
`Highlight_Traits_Model_Row_HasHighlights_Interface` it then has to implement a `getCrawler` method which returns
-you gessed it- a crawler. This is probably the finer grain of control you can get over which crawler to use for a given content.


#### The hard way: implement the crawler interface

Let's start with the hard way, for a change.

The hard way is actually the simplest to explain. You'll have to implement your own crawler by extending the abstract
one provided. Let's see what's in there:

* a unique abstract method `crawl`: it takes an array as parameter because, you never really know what to expect.
Most the time it will be populated with a unique key `query` with a string. It expected in return, an array of rows
* an `autocomplete` method: You probably don't need to override that one. it only formats the result of `crawl`
for the highlight controller
* a `crawlTable` method: This method actually does something. It splits the query string into keywords, and crawls
a table for the given fields matching these keywords

Obviously, you'll have to start with the `crawl` method. And since you're in your IDE, you probably should have a
look at the source code.


#### The simle way: configure the default crawler

What if I told you, you don't need to write code? You could just configure a crawler, very much like the default one
which would result in the instanciation of the same class but with different parameters.

The default crawlers reads from its parameters which tables it has to crawl and which fields for each of these tables.
pretty straightforward. Have a look at the module.ini file to see how the default one is configured.


### Custom field mappers

As said before, field mappers are little utility objects whose role is to format any single content into a unified structure of data.
